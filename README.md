# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal for this project is to create a bunary classifier that is capable of predicting whetherapplicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.<br>
The data that we used is a CSV ontaining more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.<br>
I have used TesorFlow, Scikit-Learn for this analysis.

## Results


## Summary
Within this challenge, I was not able to achieve the desired accuracy of 75% or more.
I have tried removing different columns, changing epochs and adding layers but there were know significant results.<br>
Using the Tanh or different activation is considered for further analysis.
